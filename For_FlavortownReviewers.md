Hi reviewer! :)
To save your time, here are some important tips:

First thing first this is perfectly legal software.
1. You must prepare an Apple ID with an active Apple Music subscription
2. Only the latest version supports English
3. If you fail to download a song, it's probably a network issue—you can ignore it
4. You don't need to test all the features

Thank you sooooo much!
