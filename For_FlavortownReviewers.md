To save your time, here are some important tips:

To change the language: go to settings find "界面语言" to change it to English.

First thing first this is perfectly legal software.

1. You must prepare an Apple ID with an active Apple Music subscription
2. Only the latest version supports English

4. You don't need to test all the features

Thank you sooooo much!
